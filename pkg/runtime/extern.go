// SetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with x to f.
// When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block
// with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs
// f(x) in a separate goroutine.  This makes x reachable again, but
// now without an associated finalizer.  Assuming that SetFinalizer
// is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees
// that x is unreachable, it will free x.
//
// SetFinalizer(x, nil) clears any finalizer associated with x.
//
// The argument x must be a pointer to an object allocated by
// calling new or by taking the address of a composite literal.
// The argument f must be a function that takes a single argument
// of x's type and can have arbitrary ignored return values.
// If either of these is not true, SetFinalizer aborts the program.
//
// Finalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have
// finalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer
// for A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run.
// If a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that
// cycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer
// is not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that
// respects the dependencies.
//
// The finalizer for x is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after
// x becomes unreachable.
// There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits,
// so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources
// associated with an object during a long-running program.
// For example, an os.File object could use a finalizer to close the
// associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards
// an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake
// to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a
// bufio.Writer, because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit.
//
// A single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially.
// If a finalizer must run for a long time, it should do so by starting
// a new goroutine.

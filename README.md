# llgo

llgo is a compiler for [Go](http://golang.org), written in Go, and using the
[LLVM](http://llvm.org) compiler infrastructure.

llgo is a fledgling, and is being developed primarily as an educational
exercise. It is not presently useful for real work. Progress will be reported
at [http://blog.awilkins.id.au](http://blog.awilkins.id.au).

# Installation

The recommended way to install llgo is to use ```go get```. You'll need to set a
couple of environment variables first:

    export CGO_CFLAGS=`llvm-config --cflags`
    export CGO_LDFLAGS="`llvm-config --ldflags` -Wl,-L`llvm-config --libdir` -lLLVM-`llvm-config --version`"
    go get github.com/axw/llgo/llgo

You must have LLVM 3.1+ in your path. At the time of writing, LLVM 3.1 has not
yet been released, so you must build it from the
[LLVM SVN repository](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#checkout).

# Running

Currently there is just a compiler which produces LLVM bitcode, and there is no
integration with gomake/goinstall/cgo, etc. To compile a Go source file, simply
run ```llgo <file.go>```, which will emit LLVM bitcode to stdout. To produce
human-readable LLVM assembly code, supply an additional ```-dump``` command
line argument before ```<file.go>```.
